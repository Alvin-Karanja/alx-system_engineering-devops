# 0x03 Shell, init files, variables and expansions :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers shell expasnsions, variables ans intializer files.
At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What happens when you type $ ls -l *.txt
* What are the /etc/profile file and the /etc/profile.d directory
* What is the ~/.bashrc file
* What is the difference between a local and a global variable
* What is a reserved variable
* How to create, update and delete shell variables
* What are the roles of the following reserved variables: HOME, PATH, PS1
* What are special parameters
* What is the special parameter $??
* What is expansion and how to use them
* What is the difference between single and double quotes and how to use them properly
* How to do command substitution with $() and backticks
* How to perform arithmetic operations with the shell
* How to create an alias
* How to list aliases
* How to temporarily disable an alias
* How to execute commands from a file in the current shell
